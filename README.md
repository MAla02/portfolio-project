# Homework Assignment: Week 1 & Week 2 - Version Control and Git Collaboration

## Project Overview
This repository contains the work for Weeks 1 and 2 of the Practical Software Engineering course.  
The focus is on learning version control systems (VCS), primarily Git, and collaboration workflows using GitHub.

## Features
- Version control basics and setup  
- Working with branches and commits  
- Remote collaboration using GitHub  
- Handling merge conflicts  
- Implementing GitFlow and GitHub Flow branching strategies  
- Creating and managing pull requests  

## Branches
This project follows GitFlow branching strategy with the following main branches:
- main: production-ready code
- develop: integration branch
- Feature branches (e.g., feature/login, feature/footer) for new features
- Hotfix branches for emergency fixes

## Basic Git Commands Used
- git status - Check current status
- git add <file> - Stage files
- git commit -m "Action: Description" - Commit changes with descriptive messages
- git push - Push changes to remote
- git pull - Pull latest changes from remote
- git checkout -b <branch-name> - Create and switch to a new branch

## Summary of Work Done
- Setup and configured Git repository
- Implemented version control and branching workflows
- Practiced collaboration with remote repositories on GitHub
- Resolved merge conflicts and used pull requests for code review

## Additional Notes
- All branches are pushed to the remote repository for visibility and collaboration.
- Commit messages follow the recommended format: "Action: Description" (e.g., Add: footer component).
- This repository includes screenshots and written reflections as part of the documentation package.

## Resources
- Git Documentation
- GitHub Flow Guide
- GitFlow Workflow
